AADAPT attempts to categorize adversary behavior in a structured and systematic way. The main components of the framework are: 

**Tactics:** which represent “why” an adversary is performing an action or the overarching goals that the attackers aim to achieve during a cyber operation.

**Techniques:** which represent “how” adversaries achieve tactical goals by performing an action. 

**Sub-techniques:** which are more detailed variations of the adversary behavior described by Techniques. A Technique may have multiple Sub-techniques, or different ways to perform the given action.  

Within the digital asset domain, AADAPT considers multiple platforms. These are specific systems or environments within a digital asset system in which an adversary may operate. A platform can refer to distributed ledger technology (DLT) frameworks (such as Hyperledger Fabric or R3 Corda), and crypto wallets (such as Trezor and Binance), as well as infrastructure for deploying decentralized applications and smart contracts (such as Google Blockchain Engine). Techniques and sub-techniques can apply to multiple platforms.
