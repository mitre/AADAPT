title: What you should not do with AADAPT
weight: 4

**Don’t use AADAPT in isolation.** The digital asset domain is built upon the foundations of enterprise and mobile technologies, so considering adversary behaviors documented in both domains can provide a more comprehensive picture. 

**Don’t seek 100% coverage of AADAPT.** Instead, organizations should focus on the tactics and techniques that pose the greatest risk to their environment. They should prioritize mitigations based on their unique threat landscape, considering both cost and impact when selecting detections and controls. 

**Don’t assume detection of a single procedure is sufficient to alert on an entire technique.** Adversaries often have several ways to carry out the same technique, so catching one method doesn’t mean the threat is fully addressed. Organizations should identify and understand other possible variations and implement additional mitigations as needed for thorough coverage. 

**Don’t limit your thinking to only the content in the AADAPT and ATT&CK matrices.** Adversaries may use behaviors that have not yet been documented or observed. Organizations should use their own intelligence sources, document any new techniques they observe, and remember that indicators of compromise beyond listed behaviors can also help detect threats.
