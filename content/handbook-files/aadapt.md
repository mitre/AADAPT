AADAPT™ (Adversarial Actions in Digital Asset Payment Technologies) is a cyber threat framework and knowledge base of adversarial techniques that could be used to launch cyber-attacks against digital asset systems These techniques are drawn from published sources about real-world cyber-attacks as well as proposed descriptions of cyber-attack methods not yet seen in the wild. The goal of AADAPT is to allow digital asset providers and other stakeholders to anticipate, understand, and counteract techniques that adversaries could use against their digital asset systems.

The AADAPT framework structure is modeled after MITRE ATT&CK® (<https://attack.mitre.org/>), a globally recognized knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. AADAPT is intended to be used in conjunction with ATT&CK and is publicly available for any person or organization to use free of charge.
