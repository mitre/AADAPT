AADAPT provides a structured approach to understanding and defending against threats in the digital asset domain. In the realm of threat intelligence, AADAPT serves as a common language for describing and sharing information about attacks on digital assets. Threat intelligence analysts can precisely map observed incidents or emerging threats to specific techniques in AADAPT, facilitating better communication and collaboration both within and between organizations. By aligning intelligence reporting with AADAPT, organizations can more effectively track adversary behaviors and anticipate future attack trends in the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem. 

The framework can help guide the development of custom analytics tailored to the unique threats facing digital asset systems. Security teams can use the techniques described in AADAPT to anticipate likely attacker behaviors, develop monitoring strategies, and plan how to respond to incidents. As the framework evolves, we welcome contributions from the community to help build out a robust library of detections and mitigations like those in ATT&CK. 

Furthermore, AADAPT enables security teams to understand realistic attack scenarios that specifically target digital asset infrastructures, such as smart contracts, wallets, and consensus mechanisms. This is particularly useful for adversary emulation and red teaming. By referencing the techniques cataloged in AADAPT, red teams can design campaigns that mirror the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of real-world adversaries, helping organizations identify gaps in their defenses and improve their incident response processes. 

From an assessment and engineering standpoint, AADAPT acts as a reference for evaluating the security posture of digital asset systems. Security architects and engineers can use the framework to assess which parts of their infrastructure are susceptible to known attack techniques and inform the design of more resilient systems. 

When deciding how to use AADAPT, it’s important to consider the scope of the environment being analyzed. Many digital asset systems rely on traditional enterprise IT infrastructure, a domain covered by ATT&CK’s Enterprise matrix for attacks on endpoints, networks, and cloud services. However, attacks that target the unique components of digital asset systems, such as blockchain infrastructure, decentralized applications, or token generation, are represented by AADAPT. In practice, organizations will likely find value in using both frameworks in tandem, mapping enterprise-level threats to ATT&CK and digital asset-specific threats to AADAPT. This dual approach supports a comprehensive, threat-informed defense strategy and can inform risk analysis and management by highlighting where further investments in security capabilities will have the greatest impact. By grounding security planning in real-world adversary behaviors and supporting evidence, organizations can better prioritize their defenses and align them with the most probable and potentially damaging threats facing their digital asset infrastructure.
