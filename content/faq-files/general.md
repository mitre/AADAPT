#### What is AADAPT?

MITRE’s Adversarial Actions in Digital Asset Payment Technologies™ (AADAPT™) is a cyber threat framework for digital asset management systems designed to be complementary to MITRE ATT&CK®. AADAPT™ allows users to analyze and secure digital assets. It provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential vulnerabilities and risks which can help inform the engineering and implementation of these systems. In addition, it serves as a resource to assist in ongoing cyber defense once systems are operational. The framework supports a range of critical use cases: it helps cyber defenders develop analytics to detect adversarial techniques, enables threat intelligence analysts to structure and compare insights using a common language, guides red teams in emulating specific threats and planning operations, and assists organizations in assessing their security capabilities and prioritizing engineering decisions. AADAPT™ can assist a wide range of stakeholders, including developers, policymakers, and users, in adopting best practices and robust security measures.

#### What are "tactics"?

Tactics are tactical adversary goals during an attack. They represent the “why” of a technique: the reason for performing an action.
Tactics serve as useful contextual categories for individual techniques and cover standard notations for things adversaries do during an operation.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

#### What are "techniques"?

Techniques describe the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals. They represent "how" an adversary achieves a tactical objective by performing an action. There can be multiple techniques in each tactic category as there are many ways to achieve tactical objectives.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

#### What are "subtechniques"?

Sub-techniques are a more specific, lower level description of the adversarial behavior used to achieve tactical goals. A technique may contain multiple sub-techniques.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

#### What technologies does AADAPT apply to?

AADAPT covers a wide range of digital asset technologies, including stablecoins, tokenized assets, centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, blockchain, and more.

#### What is the difference between AADAPT and ATT&CK?

The MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base is a worldwide de-facto standard for modeling adversarial behaviors, published and maintained by MITRE for over 10 years. ATT&CK® provides implementation-level detail about threat behaviors in three domains: Enterprise, Mobile, and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Its content is based solely upon adversary activity that has been observed in real-world use, as documented by either public or privately shared Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).
Most digital payment systems are built upon standard enterprise information technology and mobile components that process financial transactions. The TTPs documented in the MITRE ATT&CK® framework are thus highly relevant to digital asset use cases where these technologies are involved. AADAPT™ picks up where ATT&CK® leaves off, providing threat behaviors specific to digital asset implementations. Incorporating threats from both these complementary frameworks provides a comprehensive approach to identify and mitigate threats in digital asset systems.
