#### Where does the info in AADAPT come from?

The tactics and techniques that comprise the AADAPT™ framework are derived from a comprehensive analysis of real-world attacks on digital currencies and related technologies. The analysis included in-depth review of underlying technologies used to implement digital assets, focusing on credible attack methods and vulnerabilities that have been published, hypothesized, or explored in laboratory settings. Technologies examined included those, such as consensus algorithms, smart contracts, quantum computing, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems, that have limited real-world implementations and documented attacks to date. Our analysis took a predictive approach, anticipating potential threats arising from vulnerabilities in these complex technologies. This enables users and issuers to develop secure digital asset systems that preemptively address novel threats and vulnerabilities before attacks materialize. AADAPT™ will continue to be updated to remain up-to-date and relevant in addressing the complex and evolving landscape of digital asset security.
