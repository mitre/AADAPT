# AADAPT

MITRE Adversarial Actions in Digital Asset Payment Technologies (AADAPT) is a cyber threat framework that anticipates future and documents observed cyber threats to digital asset systems, in order to enable the reduction of risks posed by adversaries.  It is intended to provide comprehensive knowledge of threat behaviors, inform the development of innovative solutions, and give insights to secure digital asset systems and financial infrastructure.  AADAPT is meant to foster trust and enable growth in digital financial services.
