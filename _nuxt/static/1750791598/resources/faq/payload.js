AADAPT™ allows users to analyze and secure digital assets. It provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential vulnerabilities and risks which can help inform the engineering and implementation of these systems. In addition, it serves as a resource to assist in ongoing cyber defense once systems are operational. The framework supports a range of critical use cases: it helps cyber defenders develop analytics to detect adversarial techniques, enables threat intelligence analysts to structure and compare insights using a common language, guides red teams in emulating specific threats and planning operations, and assists organizations in assessing their security capabilities and prioritizing engineering decisions. AADAPT™ can assist a wide range of stakeholders, including developers, policymakers, and users, in adopting best practices and robust security measures."}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:f,props:{id:"what-are-tactics"},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:g,href:"#what-are-tactics",tabIndex:h},children:[{type:a,tag:i,props:{className:[j,k]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:"What are \"tactics\"?"}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"Tactics are tactical adversary goals during an attack.

Its content is based solely upon adversary activity that has been observed in real-world use, as documented by either public or privately shared Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).\nMost digital payment systems are built upon standard enterprise information technology and mobile components that process financial transactions. The TTPs documented in the MITRE ATT&CK® framework are thus highly relevant to digital asset use cases where these technologies are involved. AADAPT™ picks up where ATT&CK® leaves off, providing threat behaviors specific to digital asset implementations. Incorporating threats from both these complementary frameworks provides a comprehensive approach to identify and mitigate threats in digital asset systems."}]}]},dir:n,path:"\u002Ffaq-files\u002Fgeneral",extension:o,createdAt:l,updatedAt:l},{slug:"content",title:"Content",weight:s,toc:[],body:{type:m,children:[{type:a,tag:f,props:{id:"where-does-the-info-in-aadapt-come-from"},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:g,href:"#where-does-the-info-in-aadapt-come-from",tabIndex:h},children:[{type:a,tag:i,props:{className:[j,k]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:"Where does the info in AADAPT come from?"}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"The tactics and techniques that comprise the AADAPT™ framework are derived from a comprehensive analysis of real-world attacks on digital currencies and related technologies. The analysis included in-depth review of underlying technologies used to implement digital assets, focusing on credible attack methods and vulnerabilities that have been published, hypothesized, or explored in laboratory settings. Technologies examined included those, such as consensus algorithms, smart contracts, quantum computing, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems, that have limited real-world implementations and documented attacks to date. Our analysis took a predictive approach, anticipating potential threats arising from vulnerabilities in these complex technologies. This enables users and issuers to develop secure digital asset systems that preemptively address novel threats and vulnerabilities before attacks materialize.
