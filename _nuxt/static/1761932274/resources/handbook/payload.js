Many digital asset systems rely on traditional enterprise IT infrastructure, a domain covered by ATT&CK’s Enterprise matrix for attacks on endpoints, networks, and cloud services. However, attacks that target the unique components of digital asset systems, such as blockchain infrastructure, decentralized applications, or token generation, are represented by AADAPT. In practice, organizations will likely find value in using both frameworks in tandem, mapping enterprise-level threats to ATT&CK and digital asset-specific threats to AADAPT. This dual approach supports a comprehensive, threat-informed defense strategy and can inform risk analysis and management by highlighting where further investments in security capabilities will have the greatest impact. By grounding security planning in real-world adversary behaviors and supporting evidence, organizations can better prioritize their defenses and align them with the most probable and potentially damaging threats facing their digital asset infrastructure."}]}]},dir:h,path:"\u002Fhandbook-files\u002Faadaptdos",extension:i,createdAt:k,updatedAt:"2025-09-24T13:47:38.749Z"},{slug:"aadaptdonts",title:"What you should not do with AADAPT",weight:q,toc:[],body:{type:g,children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Don’t use AADAPT in isolation."}]},{type:a,value:" The digital asset domain is built upon the foundations of enterprise and mobile technologies, so considering adversary behaviors documented in both domains can provide a more comprehensive picture."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Don’t seek 100% coverage of AADAPT."}]},{type:a,value:" Instead, organizations should focus on the tactics and techniques that pose the greatest risk to their environment.
